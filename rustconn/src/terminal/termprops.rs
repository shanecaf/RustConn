//! The one place that knows whether this build can observe VTE termprops.
//!
//! Termprops arrived in VTE 0.78 and are how a terminal reports structured facts
//! about what the remote side is doing — as opposed to the raw byte stream every
//! other part of this module deals with. RustConn uses exactly one of them:
//! `vte.shell.postexec`, which the shell sets through OSC 133 when a command it ran
//! at the prompt has returned, carrying that command's exit code.
//!
//! Three supported build targets still ship VTE 0.76 — Ubuntu 24.04 deb, the snap's
//! `core24` platform and the noble-based AppImage — so the API is behind the
//! `vte-0-78` feature and this module is the only file that says so. Callers just
//! call [`connect_command_finished`] and get a working no-op on a build without it;
//! its return value distinguishes "nothing was connected" from "connected and the
//! remote side is quiet", which is what the startup log reports.
//!
//! The Command monitoring mode is offered by the picker regardless. Hiding it on a
//! build without the feature was considered and dropped: the picker index would then
//! mean different modes in different builds, and a `settings.toml` carrying
//! `Command` would be silently rewritten to `Off` the next time that user saved.
//! Offering a mode that stays quiet is the same observable outcome as a remote host
//! without shell integration, which the row subtitle already explains.
//!
//! # What this deliberately does not do
//!
//! *Progress.* `vte.progress.value` and `vte.progress.hint` are readable with the
//! same 0.78 API, but there is nowhere to put a percentage: `AdwTabPage` offers one
//! `indicator-icon`, which five different meanings already write to, and its `icon`
//! is the tab's protocol icon. Showing progress needs a priority scheme across
//! those writers first, which is a refactor rather than a feature.
//!
//! *Tab icons from the remote shell.* `vte.icon.image` is documented by VTE 0.84 as
//! "always unset" — upstream does not populate it yet, so there is nothing to read
//! whatever the bindings expose.
//!
//! *Current directory.* `vte.cwd` needs `ref_termprop_uri()`, which `vte4` 0.10
//! leaves ungenerated. The deprecated `current_directory_uri()` still works and
//! nothing here uses either.
//!
//! Retire the feature gate once no supported target is below VTE 0.78, and keep the
//! module: the wrapper around the ephemeral read below is worth having regardless.
